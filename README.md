# Storefront SDK

The Storefront SDK provides routing, a Flux dispatcher and common stores and actions for VTEX APIs.

### Flux

Storefront SDK uses [Alt](http://alt.js.org/) as its Flux implementation, so it's easy to create your own stores and actions.

All the stores offered by Storefront SDK are composed by [Immutable](http://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) objects, making the code safer and improving performance.
