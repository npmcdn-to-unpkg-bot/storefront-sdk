# [Storefront SDK](http://vtex-apps.github.io/storefront-sdk)

Storefront SDK is an essential tool for developing great stores using the VTEX platform.

It serves as a core library making apps live well together. It provides routing, a Flux dispatcher and common stores and actions for VTEX APIs.

### Flux

Storefront SDK uses [Alt](http://alt.js.org/) as its Flux implementation, so it's easy to create your own stores and actions.

All the stores offered by Storefront SDK are composed by [Immutable](http://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) objects, improving performance of your apps and making the code safer.
